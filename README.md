# Scientific-Calculator
This console app is a Calculator capable of multiple calculation that are typically used for both applicative and educative purposes. This is capable of evaluating single line calculations such as 1+2x3+15/3! while still accounting for the mathematical priorities up to more complex operations such as logarithms, permutations and combinations, trigonometry functions, arithmatic/geometric series and sequences, as well as  matrix operations. 

This form of calculation in divided to 2 form for easier accessibility and usage. Basic and Complex with basic storing all arithmatic operations with the addition of power, root, and factorials. While Complex modes store all the other operations.
